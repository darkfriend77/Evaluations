### Substrate C# Stack Architected, Developed & Maintained by Me

Since September 2020, I have been working on the C# Stack for Substrate, focusing on building and maintaining critical projects that form the foundation of the C# Stack for Substrate, and also the base for the Polkadot SDK for Unity. These tools are essential for enabling game developers to utilize C# as the programming language for Substrate-based projects. Below are the key projects I have architected, developed, and continue to maintain:

- [Substrate .NET API](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.API):
  The core of the Substrate C# Stack, providing essential functionality for wrapping Rust primitives and managing JSON-RPC calls to connect, access, and interact with Substrate nodes.
  - Originated from the formal project [SubstrateNetApi](https://github.com/ajuna-network/SubstrateNetApi).
  - Authored and primarily maintained by me. Check [contributions](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.API/graphs/contributors) for details.
- [Substrate .NET Toolchain](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.Toolchain):
  A vital component for utilizing the C# Stack, is the Toolchain, the code generator creates a full SDK based on a node's metadata.
  - Extends the core API client with typed access to storage elements and extrinsics.
  - Recently updated to support JSON-RPC 2.0 transaction handling ('transactionWatch_v1_submitAndWatch') and enhanced event tracking via 'TransactionEventInfo'.
  - Refactored code generation to Roslyn instead of CodeDom. [PR](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.Toolchain/pull/64)
- [Substrate .NET Wallet](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.Wallet):
  A comprehensive C# wallet stack supporting functionalities like key derivation and account creation, mirroring features available in Polkadot.JS.
- [Substrate Chains .NET](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.Chains.NET):
  A repository of pre-generated SDK artifacts for various Polkadot relay and parachains.
  - These SDKs are released as NuGet packages for easy integration into C# projects.
  - Example: [Polkadot C# SDK](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.Chains.NET/tree/main/Substrate.Polkadot.NET) and it's the published [NUGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Substrate.Polkadot.NET.Extension/1.3004.0).

### Highlights and Achievements in 2024

* **Polkadot SDK for Unity Technical Verification**: Successfully developed, published and passed the technical verification for the [Polkadot SDK for Unity](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/Polkadot.Unity.SDK) in early 2024. [LINK](https://x.com/Polkadot/status/1768337864352284813)

* **Async Backing Adoption**: Led Ajuna Network to adopt asynchronous backing with runtime upgrades on Kusama and Polkadot, becoming the first non-common-good parachains to do so through runtime upgrades. Big learnings after breaking our rococo parachain as early adopters of async backing. [LINK](https://x.com/AjunaNetwork/status/1802698678173405601)

* **BBB Android App**: Developed and published the first production mobile Unity app/game in the Google Play Store, a full-onchain game running on top of a non-EVM Polkadot Parachain (ajuna network). [LINK](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ajuna.bbb&hl=de_CH)

* **S.A.G.E. Framework**: Currently leading the architecture and development on the asset state transition engine for game backends. This framework abstracts Substrate/Rust code into basic transition functions and verification rules with free-to-play modules, anti-account farming measures, tournaments, rewards, and much more.

### A Personal Coding highlight

One personal highlight from the past year was my new solution for representing Rust enums in C#. Rust enums posed a challenge due to their design in Rust versus the strongly-typed nature of C#. My initial implementation worked effectively with Mono for Unity but caused unexpected crashes when using Unity's IL2CPP (Intermediate Language to C++ scripting backend).

#### Problem Identification and Reporting

The crash occurred during the creation of production builds for the BBB game. After extensive debugging, I identified that IL2CPP had issues handling an excessive number of generic functions with varying argument counts—up to 255. These functions were generated as part of the Rust enum wrapper abstraction in the SDK. The issue was reported to Unity to raise awareness: [Bug Report on Unity Discussions](https://discussions.unity.com/t/il2cpp-build-crashes-after-unity-logo/932833/1).

#### Solution Implementation

I redesigned the BaseEnumRust representation in the Substrate C# SDK to reduce unused code and unnecessary complexity in the wrapper abstraction.

- Old Rust enums wrapper, [BaseEnumExt](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.API/blob/0ad0b79f977823076271f6fa2774ad10f349ce52/Substrate.NetApi/Model/Types/Base/BaseEnumExt.cs), generated with the toolchain [EnumPhase](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.Chains.NET/blob/77cfb2265f8a61a3188bc81616e76b35f667ef3c/Substrate.Polkadot.NET/Substrate.Polkadot.NET.NetApiExt/NET/NetApiExt/Generated/Model/frame_system/EnumPhase.cs)
- New Rust enums wrapper, [BaseEnumRust](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.API/commit/7fab0692b357221ce6df0d50a5282a6c49aaa6b6#diff-5751eaeced72d16c7bdbff9d40c528a1be34559e852d470c9a421d061c15b449), generated with the toolchain [EnumPhase](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.Chains.NET/blob/main/Substrate.Polkadot.NET/Substrate.Polkadot.NET.NetApiExt/NET/NetApiExt/Generated/Model/frame_system/EnumPhase.cs)

## Additional Work

Over the past four years, I have contributed to numerous artifacts and projects as part of various initiatives, including:
- The Substrate Builders Program and its three milestones, which we successfully accomplished.
- Web3 Foundation Grants.
- My role as the Founder of Ajuna.
- And my personal passion as a dedicated Substrate and Polkadot enthusiast.

For many of these contributions, I played different multiple roles—some I authored and developed directly, while others I focused on providing solution architecture only. In all cases, I was responsible for inventing and shaping the ideas, as well as driving the vision and the narrative behind them.

If needed, I am happy to provide additional evidence of these contributions.

### Engagement
