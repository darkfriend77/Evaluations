### Highlights and Achievements in 2024

* **Polkadot SDK for Unity Technical Verification**: Successfully developed, published and passed the technical verification for the Polkadot SDK for Unity in early 2024. [LINK](https://x.com/Polkadot/status/1768337864352284813)

* **Async Backing Adoption**: Led Ajuna Network to adopt asynchronous backing with runtime upgrades on Kusama and Polkadot, becoming the first non-common-good parachains to do so through runtime upgrades. [LINK](https://x.com/AjunaNetwork/status/1802698678173405601)

* **BBB Android App**: Developed and published the first production mobile Unity app/game in the Google Play Store, a full-onchain game running on top of a non-EVM Polkadot Parachain (ajuna network). [LINK](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ajuna.bbb&hl=de_CH)

* **S.A.G.E. Framework**: Currently leading the architecture and development on the asset state transition engine for game backends. This framework abstracts Substrate/Rust code into basic transition functions and verification rules with free-to-play modules, anti-account farming measures, tournaments, rewards, and much more.

### A Personal Coding highlight

One personal highlight from the past year was my new solution for representing Rust enums in C#. Rust enums posed a challenge due to their design in Rust versus the strongly-typed nature of C#. My initial implementation worked effectively with Mono for Unity but caused unexpected crashes when using Unity's IL2CPP (Intermediate Language to C++ scripting backend).

#### Problem Identification and Reporting

The crash occurred during the creation of production builds for the BBB game. After extensive debugging, I identified that IL2CPP had issues handling an excessive number of generic functions with varying argument countsâ€”up to 255. These functions were generated as part of the Rust enum wrapper abstraction in the SDK. The issue was reported to Unity to raise awareness: [Bug Report on Unity Discussions](https://discussions.unity.com/t/il2cpp-build-crashes-after-unity-logo/932833/1).

#### Solution Implementation

I redesigned the BaseEnumRust representation in the Substrate C# SDK to reduce unused code and unnecessary complexity in the wrapper abstraction.

- Old Rust enums wrapper, [BaseEnumExt](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.NET.API/blob/0ad0b79f977823076271f6fa2774ad10f349ce52/Substrate.NetApi/Model/Types/Base/BaseEnumExt.cs), generated with the toolchain [EnumPhase](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.Chains.NET/blob/77cfb2265f8a61a3188bc81616e76b35f667ef3c/Substrate.Polkadot.NET/Substrate.Polkadot.NET.NetApiExt/NET/NetApiExt/Generated/Model/frame_system/EnumPhase.cs)
